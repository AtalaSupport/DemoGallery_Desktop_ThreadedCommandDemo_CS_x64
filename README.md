# Threaded Command Demo

Some of our most CPU-Intensive image processing commands implement an IThreadableCommand interface to allow them to be run multi-threaded.

This demo allows the user to test our various IThreadableCommand Image processing commands and alter the number of threads and certain other parameters. It can be used to test for optimal performance for a given command/document combination, or the source code can be examined to provide an excellent example of how to properly implement one of our threadable commands.

This is the C# version of this sample application. A [VB.NET version](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_ThreadedCommandDemo_VB_x64) is also available.


## Licensing
This application requires a license for DotImage Document Imaging. If you wish to have PDF support, you can add our PdfReader addon licensing. You may also request a 30 day evaulation if youre evaluating if DotImage / our OCR is right for you.


## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2.0.0. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2022. You must have our SDK installed (and licesed per above)

### Using NuGet for SDK Dependencies
We do publish our SDK components to NuGet. We have chosen to base the demo on local installed SDK because this leads to much smaller applications (NuGet packages add a lot of overhead due to the way they're packaged and deployed, and many of our demos -- including this one -- are often used to reproduce issues that need to be submitted to support. Apps that use NuGet are often significantly larger and run up against our maximum support case upload size)

Still, if you wish to use NuGet for the dependencies instead of relying on locally installed SDK, you can.
